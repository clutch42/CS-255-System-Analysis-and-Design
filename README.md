# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Our company has been hired by DriverPass, a company that offers online driver education courses, to create a web-based application that allows users to book driving lessons online and track their progress.

What did you do particularly well?
I think that I came up with the functional requirements particularly well. After going through the interview with the owner and IT admin several times I think I have a very good understanding of what they want out of the system we are designing. This in turn lead me to what I think are very accurate UML diagrams of the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to choose something from this project to revise, it would have to be something from the system design portion of the document, since I haven't gotten any feedback on it as of the time of this writing. I thought the invidivual business requirement portions were good until I got feedback on them, and was able to use the feedback to revise it into what I think now is a very good business requirement document.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs through a combination of reading the interview throughly many times, and a little bit of common sense. I think the functional requirements of my design are probably one of the strongest parts. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because you are designing it for them, not you.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The thing that I got from these projects is to build a strong foundation first. The interview process and collection of the needs of the user is by far the most important step. From there you can build on it and create all the requirements and make charts to your hearts content, but if it is all based on something the user doen't need or want, then there is no need for any of it.
